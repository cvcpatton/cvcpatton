# About me

I'm transitioning into software development after 20+ years in higher education and biotech. Now specializing in Python, Java, and JavaScript, I've built projects ranging from console applications to full-stack web apps. I bring strong problem-solving, communication, and teamwork skills to every project.

Je parle francais.
Parlo italiano.
